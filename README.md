# Bounded Random Walks

## Goal

With this repository, I intend to simulate a variety of random walks and generate probability distirbutions for certain metrics of interest. In particular, I will focus on what happens when you look at metrics related to reaching a target distance from the start. I will generate the data in Rust for performance reasons as well as interest in getting to know the language better. I will probably handle visualizing the data in Python, unless I find Rust has visualization tools that suit my needs.
